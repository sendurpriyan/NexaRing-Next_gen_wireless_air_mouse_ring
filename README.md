# NexaRing: Next-Generation Wireless Air Mouse Ring

This project showcases a compact, wearable air mouse ring that combines convenience and functionality for seamless interaction with devices. Designed for next-generation applications, it uses motion sensors to track gestures, enabling precise cursor control and gesture-based inputs without a traditional mouse. The ring communicates wirelessly (e.g., via Bluetooth) with your computer or smart device, offering an ergonomic and futuristic alternative for presentations, gaming, or daily use.


## Objectives

By removing the limitations of conventional mouse systems, this novel method promises to 
improve user mobility and intuitive engagement. It is especially helpful in situations like 
business travel, academic conferences, and mobile officiating. 

create the air mouse ring innovative and tiny as it wearable to human fingers. User could be able to use the mouse with convenience. 
The mouse could be used in three-dimensional space volume which refers air mouse mode and it should contain basic mouse operations in very user-friendly way. 
As an additional feature of gesture mode should be implemented to the air mouse; from these gesture mode users can perform some gesture controlling operations to the pc. 
The device should be compatible with various types of personal computers. Such are, laptops, desktops, tablets, mobiles etc. 
Create the mouse device which is rechargeable and could work for more time in single charge.
